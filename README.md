# vcard4

__vcard4__ is a javascript library for generating and parsing version 4.0 vCards. It can also be used to generate XML vCards and jCards. 

__vcard4__ may be used in node or in the browser, and it supports ESM and UMD.

This library fully implements RFC 6350 (vCard), RFC 6351 (XML vCard), RFC 7095 (jCard), and RFC 6350 extensions including RFC 6474, RFC 8605, RFC 6715, RFC 6868, RFC 6473 and RFC 7852.

The library is fully tree shakable. Only what you import will end up in your final bundle.
